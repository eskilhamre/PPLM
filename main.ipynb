    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook can be used to both train a discriminator on the AG news dataset  and steering text generation in the direction of each of the four classes of this dataset, namely world, sports, business and sci/tech.   \n",
    "\n",
    "My code uses and builds on a text generation plug-and-play model developed by the Uber AI research team, which can be found here: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM.    \n",
    "I had a lot of problems setting up the code provided by the original paper, since the package versions is old and has a lot of incompatability issues. I spent loads of times trying to set up pip and/or anaconda environments to run their code, but there was always an issue.   \n",
    "Therefore, I developed this in Google Colab, which seems to be the only place where I can run their code without problems. **I strongly recommend you running this in Google Colab as well**. Thus, my code is kind of hard to use exactly because the original PPLM code is hard to use. I forked the PPLM repo and removed lots of unecessary stuff, only keeping the parts I'm using in this notebook. Also, I added my newly trained discriminator model.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "By running this entire notebook cell for cell, you both train the discriminator and performs the generation experiment. However, since I've already trained this very discriminator, you can skip those cells. You can also skip the cells corresponding to saving models and results to disk. I've marked the \"mandatory\" cells with the comment \"# MUST BE RUN\" for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main functionality\n",
    "This notebook essentially just runs my experiment setup using the newly trained discriminator to steer text generation in the direction of the discriminator classes text.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "The main function is named *text_generation*, which can be used to generate a user-chosen amount of samples using either an unperturbed model or perturbed model. In the latter case, the user might choose which class he/she wished to steer text generation towards. I should also say that it's not quite new functionality, it's based on some of the PPLM code modified to suit my experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Termology used throughout:\n",
    "- Model setting: using a general language model (GPT-2) together with the discriminator fixed on optimizing for one specific class.\n",
    "- Perturbed and unperturbed: This is essentially whether a discriminator has been used in the text generation. For instance, unperturbated text is \"clean\", meaning unsteered, while perturbated text is steered in a class direction."
