# PPLM
Plug and Play Language Model implementation. Allows to steer topic and attributes of GPT-2 models.

# Introduction
This is part of the code used in my final project for a graduate-level Natural language processing course at UiB. It's just a simplefied version of the original PPLM repo, containing all the necessary code to steer language generation in a simple manner. I've added another discriminator model trained on the AG news dataset.   
Thus, the model can be used to steer language generation in the following news directions: global, sports, business and sci/tech.
